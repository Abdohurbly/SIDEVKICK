# SIDEVKICK

### Your local Dev sidekick that Gets it (Done)

[![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-yellow.svg)](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT)

SIDEVKICK is a tool designed to assist developers by integrating AI capabilities directly into their local development workflow. It helps with tasks like code editing, refactoring, generation, explanation, and more, using the GenAI models of your choice.

## ‚ú® Features

- **AI-Powered Coding Assistance:** Leverage Google Gemini models for code generation, refactoring, explanation, and suggestions.
- **Interactive Chat Interface:** Communicate with the AI to get help with your coding tasks.
- **Integrated Code Editor:** View and edit your project files directly within the application using Monaco Editor.
- **File Explorer:** Easily navigate your project's directory structure.
- **Apply AI Suggestions:** Review and apply AI-suggested changes (file edits, new file/folder creation, shell command execution) with a diff view.
- **Backend API:** A robust FastAPI backend to handle AI interactions and file operations.
- **Modern Frontend:** A responsive React (TypeScript) frontend built with Vite and Material-UI for a clean user experience.
- **Git Integration:** Basic Git operations (status, add, commit, push, pull, branch) from the UI.
- **Configurable:** Set your API key and choose your preferred AI model.
- **Live Preview:** (For web projects) An integrated iframe to preview changes.

## üß† Supported AI Models

This agent currently supports multiple providers and their latest models:

### **Gemini (by Google):**

- `gemini-2.0-flash-exp`
- `gemini-1.5-pro`
- `gemini-1.5-flash`
- `gemini-1.5-flash-8b`
- `gemini-2.5-pro-preview-05-06`
- `gemini-2.5-flash-preview-05-20`
- `gemini-2.5-flash-preview-native-audio-dialog`

### **Claude (by Anthropic):**

- `claude-3.5-sonnet`
- `claude-3-opus`
- `claude-3-haiku`

### **GPT (by OpenAI):**

- GPT-4-turbo and future support for GPT-4.5 and GPT-5 models.

> ‚úÖ You can switch models dynamically from the configuration panel.

## üîç Smart Context System (RAG vs Smart Static Analysis)

The agent supports two powerful methods to understand your codebase context:

### ‚úÖ Smart Retrieval (RAG ‚Äì Retrieval-Augmented Generation)

- Uses embeddings and a semantic vector index (FAISS + SentenceTransformers) to retrieve **only the most relevant code chunks** for your query.
- Helps avoid noisy context and focuses the model on precise logic.
- Enables file-level dependency understanding, class/function metadata, and component detection.

### üî¨ Smart Static Context (without RAG)

- Even when RAG is disabled, the agent performs **intelligent static analysis** to determine relevant files and context.
- It detects UI components, code complexity, function/class declarations, and structural relationships across files.
- This hybrid approach ensures that context sent to the model is focused and high-quality ‚Äî even in full-project scans.

> You can toggle RAG on/off via UI or API. Both methods work intelligently behind the scenes using semantic metadata, not just raw file dumps.

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.9 or higher
- Node.js 18.x or higher and npm (or yarn)
- Git
- A Google Gemini API Key (or an API key for your chosen AI provider if you adapt the agent)

### Installation & Setup

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Abdohurbly/local-ai-developer-agent.git
   cd local-ai-developer-agent
   ```

2. **Backend Setup:**

   - Navigate to the project root directory.
   - Create and activate a Python virtual environment:

     ```bash
     python -m venv venv
     source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
     ```

   - Install Python dependencies:

     ```bash
     pip install -r requirements.txt
     ```

3. **Frontend Setup:**

   - Navigate to the `frontend` directory:

     ```bash
     cd frontend
     ```

   - Install Node.js dependencies:

     ```bash
     npm install
     # or if you use yarn:
     # yarn install
     ```

   - Go back to the project root directory:

     ```bash
     cd ..
     ```

### Configuration

- The application allows you to configure your AI API Key and select the AI model through the UI (Settings page).
- Ensure your API key has the necessary permissions to use the selected GenAI models.

## üèÉ Running the Application

1. **Start the Backend Server:**

   - From the project root directory (ensure your Python virtual environment is activated):

     ```bash
     uvicorn backend_api:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000 --reload
     ```

   - The backend API will be running at `http://localhost:8000`.

2. **Start the Frontend Development Server:**

   - Open a new terminal, navigate to the `frontend` directory:

     ```bash
     cd frontend
     ```

   - Run the development server:

     ```bash
     npm run dev
     # or if you use yarn:
     # yarn dev
     ```

   - The frontend application will be accessible at `http://localhost:3000` (or another port if 3000 is in use, check your terminal output).

3. **Access the Application:**

   - Open your web browser and go to `http://localhost:3000`.
   - Configure your API Key and load your project path via the Settings page in the UI.
