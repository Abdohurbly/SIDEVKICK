Local AI Developer Agent is a tool designed to assist developers by integrating AI capabilities directly into their local development workflow. It helps with tasks like code editing, refactoring, generation, explanation, and more, using a powerful AI model (Google Gemini) as its backbone.

## ‚ú® Features

- **AI-Powered Coding Assistance:** Leverage Google Gemini models for code generation, refactoring, explanation, and suggestions.
- **Interactive Chat Interface:** Communicate with the AI to get help with your coding tasks.
- **Integrated Code Editor:** View and edit your project files directly within the application using Monaco Editor.
- **File Explorer:** Easily navigate your project's directory structure.
- **Apply AI Suggestions:** Review and apply AI-suggested changes (file edits, new file/folder creation, shell command execution) with a diff view.
- **Backend API:** A robust FastAPI backend to handle AI interactions and file operations.
- **Modern Frontend:** A responsive React (TypeScript) frontend built with Vite and Material-UI for a clean user experience.
- **Git Integration:** Basic Git operations (status, add, commit, push, pull, branch) from the UI.
- **Configurable:** Set your API key and choose your preferred AI model.
- **Live Preview:** (For web projects) An integrated iframe to preview changes.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

- **Backend:**
  - Python 3.9+
  - FastAPI
  - Uvicorn (ASGI server)
  - Google Generative AI SDK (`google-generativeai`)
- **Frontend:**
  - React 18+
  - TypeScript
  - Vite
  - Material-UI (MUI)
  - Monaco Editor (for the code editor component)
  - Axios (for API communication)
- **AI Model:** Google Gemini (e.g., `gemini-2.5-pro-preview-05-06`, configurable)

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.9 or higher
- Node.js 18.x or higher and npm (or yarn)
- Git
- A Google Gemini API Key (or an API key for your chosen AI provider if you adapt the agent)

### Installation & Setup

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/local-ai-developer-agent.git # Replace with your repo URL
    cd local-ai-developer-agent
    ```

2.  **Backend Setup:**
    - Navigate to the project root directory.
    - Create and activate a Python virtual environment:
      ```bash
      python -m venv venv
      source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
      ```
    - Install Python dependencies:
      ```bash
      pip install -r requirements.txt
      ```

3.  **Frontend Setup:**
    - Navigate to the `frontend` directory:
      ```bash
      cd frontend
      ```
    - Install Node.js dependencies:
      ```bash
      npm install
      # or if you use yarn:
      # yarn install
      ```
    - Go back to the project root directory:
      ```bash
      cd ..
      ```

### Configuration

- The application allows you to configure your Gemini API Key and select the AI model through the UI (Settings page).
- Ensure your API key has the necessary permissions to use the selected Gemini models.

## üèÉ Running the Application

1.  **Start the Backend Server:**
    - From the project root directory (ensure your Python virtual environment is activated):
      ```bash
      uvicorn backend_api:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000 --reload
      ```
    - The backend API will be running at `http://localhost:8000`.

2.  **Start the Frontend Development Server:**
    - Open a new terminal, navigate to the `frontend` directory:
      ```bash
      cd frontend
      ```
    - Run the development server:
      ```bash
      npm run dev
      # or if you use yarn:
      # yarn dev
      ```
    - The frontend application will be accessible at `http://localhost:3000` (or another port if 3000 is in use, check your terminal output).

3.  **Access the Application:**
    - Open your web browser and go to `http://localhost:3000`.
    - Configure your API Key and load your project path via the Settings page in the UI.
